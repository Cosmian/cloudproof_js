## [6.0.1] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- Add `insecureFetchChainsBatchSize` argument to `Findex.search` to reduce the number of `fetchChains` calls during searches

### Changed

- `fetchChains` calls are now run in async parallel

---

## [6.0.0] - 2022-12-22

### Added

- NodeJS support
- encrypt/decrypt with the KMS
- `Location.fromUuid()`
- Verify non regression test vectors for CoverCrypt
- New simple API for CoverCrypt (new functions `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `generateMasterKeys`, `generateUserSecretKey` and `rotateAttributes`)

### Changed

- Findex 1.0
- Simplify `search` signature (move optional options to an `options` object at the end)
- `search` now return `SearchResults`, use `locations()` to get all the locations, use `getAllIndexedValues()` to get the full `IndexedValue` list
- `decrypt` function for CoverCrypt now return an object containing the decrypted header metadata and the plaintext decrypted value
- WASM files are now base64 inline in the lib
- `KmipClient` is now `KmsClient`
- Removed `client.post()` function, please use the specific functions on the `KmsClient` object.
- Refactor the KMS structures (snake case to camel case for properties, change some typesâ€¦)
- Rename `*abe*` to `*CoverCrypt*` in KMS functions
- Rename `ClearTextHeader` to `PlaintextHeader`
- Rename `additionalData` to `headerMetadata`
- Switch from Jest to Vitest

### Removed

- `options.generateGraphs` in the `upsert` function. Please use `generateAliases()` to build the keywords/nextwords (see VueJS or ReactJS examples)
- In `Location`, `Keyword` and `Label`: `fromUtf8String()`, replaced by `fromString()`

### Fixed

- `AccessPolicy.toKmipJson` and `AccessPolicy.toVendorAttribute` are now async (because they call the WASM)
