### Cryptographic libraries

Pre-compiled versions of `CoverCrypt`, `GPSW` and `Findex` are available in the `wasm_lib` directory.

To build a new version of those, git clone them in a directory `crypto_libs` then run `./build_and_run.sh crypto_lib` to build them, compile the js lib and launch the demo app.
